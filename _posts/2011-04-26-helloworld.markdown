As everyone else, the very first step in programming and probably in blogging world is a Hello World thing, so I am going to do the same.

I am still getting used to the WordPress user-friendly interface and various tools available. So far so good and I like it :-)

Here is my Hello World in bash:

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

printf "%s\n" 'Hello World!'
{% endhighlight %}

More posts to follow, hopefully some people will find it useful in one way or another.
